I found that I yearned to express my creative side, and wasn't able to do so in my career.</p>
        <p>(Enter stage right...) <em>Coding!</em> </p>
        <p>My short journey into coding has been very exciting. I have enjoyed learning to put my computer skills to use while being able to develope a new creative skill. The coding skill will be vital to scratch my creative itch.</p>
    <p>I have been a nurse for <a href= "https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Dp3JtN0NUuQSpMBPWbJFLFQsk1VUrvfqBLCM4S-O5iI/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank"><span >11 years</span></a>, and I am ready to move onto the next phase of my life. Coding has been a thirilling experience to learn and stretch my logic muscles and I am excited to continue on my path of becoming a full time web developer.</p></div>
